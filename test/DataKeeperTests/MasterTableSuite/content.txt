Metadata driven Master tables

Identical concept to Hub tables in the Data Vault framework, just a different name.

Structure of generic master table
|master_key|surrogate key (integer). The actual tables will not use this column name. e.g. mst_policy_key|
|master_id|business identifier. The actual tables will not use this column name e.g. policy_id|
|row_load_dttm|date and time the record was added to table|
|row_source_id|description of the origin of the business identifier|

Requirements:
Business ids are only loaded once.
Transformation should be flexible enough to work with any source table and any destination master table. (driven by metadata)

Assumptions:
For our purposes, assume sources are available on same database connection as destination i.e. the data warehouse
