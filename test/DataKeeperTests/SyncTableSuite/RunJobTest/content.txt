!4 Run a single transformation based on ID
The ext-sync-table-job runs a single transformation. 
It uses the transformation id to retrieve metadata from the meta tables and passes
that information to ext-sync-table.

Important note: For security reasons, we do not store database passwords (even encrypted ones) in the meta_connections table.
However, we still need the password to connect to our source. The sync table job retrieves the password from a file named .passwords 
on the local filesystem. It expects it to be located in the same directory as the job itself and the format to be:
{{{
local=password
othersource=otherpassowrd
...
<connection_id>=<password>
}}}
where ''connection_id'' corresponds to meta_connections.connection_id. So remember you need to update this file when you edit meta_connections.

Do a simple row test to check that sync table transformation actually ran.
